OrderedDictionary is a lightweight implementation of an ordered dictionary data structure in Swift.

The `OrderedDictionary` struct is a generic collection that combines the features of `Dictionary` and `Array` data structures from the Swift standard library. Like `Dictionary`, it stores key-value pairs with each key being unique and maps each key to an associated value. Like `Array`, it stores those pairs sorted and accessible by a zero-based integer index.

`OrderedDictionary` provides similar APIs to collections in the Swift standard library like accessing contents by keys or indices, inserting and removing elements, iterating, sorting, filtering, etc.

Internally, `OrderedDictionary` uses a backing storage composed of a `Dictionary` for storing the key-value pairs and an `Array` for managing the ordered keys. This architecture makes it not the most pefromant implementation possible, but it gets its job done while reusing most functionality from the Swift standard library.

## Requirements

- Swift 4.2+
- Xcode 10.0+
- iOS 8.0+ / macOS 10.10+

*The Xcode and OS requirements apply only when the library is integrated as a framework or via the Xcode project.*

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To install OrderedDictionary using the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add it as a dependency into your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/lukaskubanek/OrderedDictionary.git", from: "2.0.0")
    ],
    ...
)
```

### Carthage

To install OrderedDictionary using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add it as a dependency into your `Cartfile`:

```plain
github "lukaskubanek/LoremSwiftum"
```

Then drag either the `OrderedDictionary.xcodeproj` or the `OrderedDictionary.framework` into your Xcode project/workspace and link your target against the `OrderedDictionary.framework`. Make sure that the framework [gets copied](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) to your application bundle.

### Git Submodules

You can also install OrderedDictionary via [Git submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) and integrate the project `OrderedDictionary.xcodeproj` from the submodule directly into your Xcode workspace.

### ⚠️ Note About CocoaPods

Although there has been a high demand for [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) support, this distribution method won't be officially supported by this library. If you really want to integrate this library via CocoaPods, you can create and maintain a custom podspec (see the last section of [this post](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#pod)).

## Usage & Docs

For the usage of this library please refer to [the example playground](Playgrounds/OrderedDictionary.playground/Contents.swift). For documentation please refer to [the documentation comments](Sources/OrderedDictionary.swift).
