**OrderedDictionary** is a lightweight implementation of an ordered dictionary data structure in Swift.

The `OrderedDictionary` structure is an immutable generic collection which combines the features of `Dictionary` and `Array` from the Swift standard library. Like `Dictionary` it stores key-value pairs and maps each key to a value. Like `Array` it stores those pairs sorted and accessible by a zero-based integer index.

`OrderedDictionary` provides similar APIs like collections in the Swift standard library. This includes accessing contents by keys or indexes, inserting and removing elements, iterating, sorting etc.

Internally `OrderedDictionary` uses a backing store composed of an instance of `Dictionary` for storing the key-value pairs and an instance of `Array` for managing the ordered keys. This means it is not the most performant implementation possible, but it gets its job done by reusing most functionality from the Swift standard library.

## Requirements

- Swift 3.0
- Xcode 8.1
- iOS 8.0+ / OS X 10.10+

## Installation

This library is distributed as a Swift framework and can be integrated into your project in following ways:

### Carthage

The easiest way is to use the package manager [Carthage][6].

1. Add `github "NSLogxiaoyu3/OrderedDictionary"` to your `Cartfile`.
2. Run `carthage bootstrap`.
3. Drag either the `OrderedDictionary.xcodeproj` or the `OrderedDictionary.framework` into your project/workspace and link your target against the `OrderedDictionary.framework`.
4. Make sure the framework [gets copied][7] to your application bundle.
5. Import the framework using `import OrderedDictionary`.

### Submodule & Xcode Project

Another option is to use [Git submodules][8] and integrating the Xcode project `OrderedDictionary.xcodeproj` directly to your Xcode workspace.

## Usage

For the usage of this library please refer to the [example playground][9].
